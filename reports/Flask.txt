What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?

Flask accomplishes the bulk of the TCP/HTTP work on our server, parsing and sending responses for both GET and POST request.
It also handles most of our html templating using the the Jinja2 style templates.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

How does this technology accomplish what it does?

We implement the following functions/methods from the flask library:

.route()
  this method invokes the add_url_rule() with the function directly below it for the function argument. 
  
  add_url_rule() responds to a GET request at the specified path and then calls the specified function.
  
render_template()
  Calls _render on the specified template which in turn calls render().
  
  render() sends an HTTP response for the requested template. render also can take additonal arguments of the form variable_name = "String".
  it will replace the variable in the HTML template (designated by {{ variable_name }} as designated by the Jinja2 template style) with the 
  corresponding string.
  
request.args.get()
  Parses the query string in the URL and returns the value of the designated string.
  
 url_for()
  Gets the url for the specified html file.
  
 redirect()
  Sends an HTTP redirect response to the designated url.
  
 flash()
  Adds a message to the session flashed messages. These messages can then be retreived and added to an HTML file using {{ get_flashed_messages }},
  and a Jinja2 for loop to add all messages. flash can also take an addition aparameter to designate different kinds of messages for example 'accept'
  and 'error'.

What license(s) or terms of service apply to this technology?

Flask operates under a three clause BSD clause to quote the official documentation this roughly means: "do whatever you want with it as long as the copyright 
in Flask sticks around, the conditions are not modified and the disclaimer is present. Furthermore you must not use the names of the authors to promote 
derivatives of the software without written consent."

To further clarify this means that Flask is freely available to use, however one cannot redistribute Flask source code, binary forms, or documentation without
maintating the following copyright notice: "Copyright (c) 2015 by Armin Ronacher and contributors". Since we will not be redistributing any Flask Source Code
this wont affect our project.

Additionally, we cannot use the names of the authors to promote our product without permission from the author themself. Again, since we will not be promoting
our web app this does not apply to our project.
