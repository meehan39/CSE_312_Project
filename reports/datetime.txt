Datetime Module

What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?

	The datetime module allows me to track the current time it is when a user makes a request to the server and based on that I can tell that a user
  is online or offline if they have made a request within the last ten minutes.


How does this technology accomplish what it does?

The Following objects/functions were implemented from the Datetime Module:

	The datetime module works in that it follows the gregorian calendar which is the solar calendar used by most of the world and tracks the current date.

In the source code, the following function is what keeps track of the current date:
	https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/datetime.py#L88


now():
	This function returns the current local date and time. It also takes an optional timezone parameter but if this second parameter is unspecified
  it uses the local time zone.

https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Lib/datetime.py#L1696


strptime():
	This function returns a string which represents the date and the time in a specific format. It takes a datetime object as the first
  parameter and the format string is the second parameter

Class timedelta:
	Returns a duration representing the difference between two time instances or date instances with millisecond precision. Addition and/or subtraction can be done.
