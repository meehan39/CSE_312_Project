What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?

Socket-io is a javascript library that offers real-time communication between clients and servers through the triggering of events.
The server can talk to the clients and vice versa.
Flask-socketio allows for the integration of the socketio library with the Flask framework. It references the python-socketio library which implements
integrations of socketio client and server with python.
This real time communication allows users to communicate with each other (whether it be through chat or posts) live.



How does this technology accomplish what it does?

emit()
    This method sends a message under a pre-set or custom event name to all connected clients.
    The emit() parameters takes the event the user wants to send out, and a dictionary data in JSON form.
    The event payload can be represented as a JSON blob. Because this function receives data from the client
    it can only be called from a socketio event handler.

SocketIO
  - before a socket makes the connection between the server and the client, it performs an HTTP handshake.

  .on()

    Socketio.on is an event emitter that sends and receives messages from the server. The socket waits for a request from the client. The server
    handles these event request similar to how flask handles routes. The server is going to connect then send that message to everyone.
    As its parameters, it takes the name of an event and a namespace.
    Flask_socketio creates a server-side event handler and sends out connection, disconnection, and other event requests to the client. It can also
    send out messages using the emit function(explained above).

  .init_app()

    init_app creates a flask_socketio server. It takes an instance of a socketio app and initilizes it. This replaces Flask's standard app.run(app) and
    introduces SocketIO to the application.
    This method of initializing is being used instead of socketio.run(app) because init_app() allows for an sqlite3 object instantiation and configuration of
    the database without an app object.
