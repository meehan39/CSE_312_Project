What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?

Flask_Login allows us to add secure authentication and session management to our app.
It will allow users to easily sign up, log in and log out in a secure way.

How does this technology accomplish what it does?

We implement the following objects/functions from the flask_login library:

LoginManager
    This is an object used to hold settings used for logging in.  The only attribute we are altering for this app is the .login_view field.
    We then call the .init_app() method which sets all the configurations

login_user()
    This method takes in a user object and a boolean value to log the user in if their credentials are correct.  This method will generate
    a random session token and set it as a cookie in the users browser.  If the remember field is set to true, the token will persist after
    the user closes and reopens their browser.

logout_user()


login_required()
