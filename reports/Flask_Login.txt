What does this technology (library/framework/service) accomplish for you?

Flask_Login allows us to add secure authentication and session management to our app.
It will allow users to easily sign up, log in and log out in a secure way.

How does this technology accomplish what it does?

We implement the following objects/functions from the flask_login library:

LoginManager
    This is an object used to hold settings used for logging in.  The only attribute we are altering for this app is the .login_view field.
    (Source: login_manager.py Line 30, https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login/blob/c77ba6b12ef5e3045df054cf8bf2d61c4d83f54f/flask_login/login_manager.py#L30)
    We then call the .init_app() method which sets all the configurations.

current_user
    This is an instance of the current user of the application.  It is set by calling the get_user() method which pops the top user off of
    a stack of users and getting the "user" attribute, which will be the current user using the app or None of they are not logged in.  It then
    calls the _load_user() function which gets all the information about the user including their user id and authentication token, which it 
    will search for in the request headers.

    (Source: login_manager.py Line 310, https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login/blob/c77ba6b12ef5e3045df054cf8bf2d61c4d83f54f/flask_login/login_manager.py#L310)

login_user()
    This method takes in a user object and a boolean value to log the user in if their credentials are correct.  This method adds the id 
    of the user to the session information stored in a dictionary and sets the is_authenticated field in the current_user to True.  It 
    then will generate a random session token and set it as a cookie in the users browser.  If the remember field is set to true, the token 
    will persist after the user closes and reopens their browser.

logout_user()
    This method takes in no parameters and logs the user out by removing them from the list of currently logged in users, setting is_authenticated
    on current_user to False and removes the remember me cookie if it exists.
    (Source: utils.py Line 195, https://github.com/maxcountryman/flask-login/blob/c77ba6b12ef5e3045df054cf8bf2d61c4d83f54f/flask_login/utils.py#L195)

login_required
    This is a decorator used to ensure that the user is logged in before calling the actual view.  Essentially all this does is check if
    the current_user.is_authenticated is set to True.  If so, the page will be displayed.  If not, the .unauthorized() function is called and
    the user will be redirected to the login page.

What license(s) or terms of service apply to this technology?

Since Flask Login is made for use with Flask and by the same group that made Flask, the terms of use are the exact same.  As with Flask, 
since we are not redistributing the Flask Login source code or promoting our app we are good to go.
